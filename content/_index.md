        As a Security Analyst with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, and Aviation, my mission is to contribute to the advancement of secure, intelligent systems that drive innovation and resilience across various industries. I specialize in analyzing and mitigating bot attacks â€” a persistent and evolving threat that impacts a broad spectrum of organizations and businesses.
        
        Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, I explore ways to enhance the cyber security posture of businesses by creating, augmenting, and refining tools, applications, and programs that improve operational processes and system defenses.
        
        I am always open to meaningful collaborations. If youâ€™re interested in working together to tackle complex cyber security challenges, particularly in the realm of automation, AI, and threat mitigationâ€”please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch. ðŸ˜ƒ
