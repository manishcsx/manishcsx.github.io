I developed a Python-based web scraper to interact with 
a test e-commerce domain (http://manishsas.t1cloudwaf.com/) 
for three minutes. The scraper continuously scans the site, 
taking a screenshot if a condition ("Size M") becomes available. 
The project aimed to evaluate Imperva's Anti-Bot Protection (ABP), 
with the scraper designed to simulate human-like behavior by using 
a local browser, unlike typical command-line bots.
