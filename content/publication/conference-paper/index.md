abstract: This research paper consists of an analysis of the history, trends, and research opportunities of cyber security in satellite technologies. The paper delves into the history of satellite technologies and past events of cyber-attacks that had occurred. Emerging trends such as the evolution of cyber- enabled disruptions, cyber threats on space-link communications, and cyber-attack vectors on unpatched and outdated legacy softwareâ€™s deployed in satellite technologies is also investigated. Lastly, possible research opportunities such as the development of unilateral cyber-security standards, frameworks, and laws that could improve the overall governance of satellite technologies is explored. The research into the modernization of satellite legacy systems, common security architecture and the implementation of quantum communication encryption for satellite communications are investigated in a bid to improve the current cyber security posture in satellite technologies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper analyzes the history, current trends, and future research opportunities in cybersecurity for satellite technologies. It reviews past cyber-attacks on satellites, explores emerging threats like cyber disruptions, vulnerabilities in space-link communications, and risks from outdated legacy systems. The study also identifies research opportunities, including the need for standardized cybersecurity frameworks, modernizing legacy systems, developing unified security architectures, and exploring quantum encryption to enhance satellite cybersecurity.
