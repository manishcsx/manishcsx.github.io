abstract: This project, undertaken as part of a Master’s capstone, focuses on enhancing a data visualization dashboard that analyzes bike usage patterns within the Perth CBD. Developed in collaboration with an industry partner, the dashboard aims to support urban transport planning and promote mode sharing by identifying high-usage bike paths, peak riding periods, and areas requiring infrastructure improvements. It incorporates spatial and speed data analysis to uncover safety and connectivity gaps, while also fostering community engagement to strengthen the local cycling culture. Leveraging tools such as ArcMap, the platform offers robust mapping, data management, and statistical capabilities in a user-friendly interface, enabling clear insights and actionable reporting for stakeholders.
