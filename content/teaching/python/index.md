This [Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c3a533e545db46029d817b9cbafdb8a1) was part of my Master’s final capstone project, where I collaborated closely with an industry partner to augment a dashboard designed to analyze bike usage patterns in Perth’s CBD. The dashboard supports data-driven decisions by identifying peak usage periods, high-traffic areas, and infrastructure gaps to improve transport planning and encourage mode sharing.
